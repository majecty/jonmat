It is based on the\n\t * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n\t * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n\t * <p>\n\t * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n\t *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n\t *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n\t *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n\t *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n\t *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n\t *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n\t *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n\t */\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n\t * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n\t * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\t *\n\t *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\t *\n\t * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n\t * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\t * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\t * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n\t * limitations under the License.\n\t */\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * @name ClusterIconStyle\n\t * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n\t *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.

The <code>styles</code> array element used has an index of\n *  <code>index</code> minus 1. For example, the default <code>calculator</code> returns a\n *  <code>text</code> value of <code>\"125\"</code> and an <code>index</code> of <code>3</code>\n *  for a cluster icon representing 125 markers so the element used in the <code>styles</code>\n *  array is <code>2</code>.

Icons such\n * as these look better when viewed on high-resolution monitors such as Apple's Retina displays.\n * Note: if this property is <code>true</code>, sprites cannot be used as cluster icons.\n * @property {number} [batchSize=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE] Set this property to the\n *  number of markers to be processed in a single batch when using a browser other than\n *  Internet Explorer (for Internet Explorer, use the batchSizeIE property instead).\n * @property {number} [batchSizeIE=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE_IE] When Internet Explorer is\n *  being used, markers are processed in several batches with a small delay inserted between\n *  each batch in an attempt to avoid Javascript timeout errors.
